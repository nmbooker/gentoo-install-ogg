 * This package attempts to override the Mozilla GMPInstaller auto-update process,
 * however even if it is not successful in doing so the profile-installed plugin
 * will not be used unless this package is removed.  This package will take precedence
 * over any gmp-gmpopenh264 that may be installed in a user's profile.

 * have install one of the supported credentials management applications:
 * - app-crypt/libsecret (GNOME)
 * - kde-frameworks/kwallet (KDE)
 * If you have one of above packages installed, but don't want to use
 * them in Chromium, then add --password-store=basic to CHROMIUM_BIN_FLAGS

 * 
 * (Note: Above message is only printed the first time package is
 * installed. Please look at /usr/share/doc/chromium-bin-109.0.5414.74/README.gentoo*
 * for future reference)
 * For VA-API support you need to install media-libs/libva with
 * USE=X enabled.
 * 
 * VA-API is disabled by default at runtime. You have to enable it
 * by adding --enable-features=VaapiVideoDecoder to CHROMIUM_BIN_FLAGS
 * in /etc/chromium-bin/default.
 * 
 * Qt5 is disabled by default at runtime. You have to enable it
 * by adding --enable-features=AllowQt5 to CHROMIUM_BIN_FLAGS
 * in /etc/chromium-bin/default. Afterwards you can select the
 * Qt5 theme in Settings->Appearance.
 * 
 * chromium-bin profile defaults to ${HOME}/.config/chromium-bin.
 * Some extensions (e.g. KeepassXC) expect default chromium profile
 * at ${HOME}/.config/chromium. You can overwrite this by adding
 * --user-data-dir=${HOME}/.config/chromium to CHROMIUM_BIN_FLAGS
 * in /etc/chromium-bin/default.

 * GNU info directory index is up-to-date.
