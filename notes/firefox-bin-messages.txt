 * Messages for package www-client/firefox-bin-110.0.1:

 *
 * Note regarding Trusted Recursive Resolver aka DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH):
 * Due to privacy concerns (encrypting DNS might be a good thing, sending all
 * DNS traffic to Cloudflare by default is not a good idea and applications
 * should respect OS configured settings), "network.trr.mode" was set to 5
 * ("Off by choice") by default.
 * You can enable DNS-over-HTTPS in Firefox-bin's preferences.
 *
 * Upstream operates a service named Normandy which allows Mozilla to
 * push changes for default settings or even install new add-ons remotely.
 * While this can be useful to address problems like 'Armagadd-on 2.0' or
 * revert previous decisions to disable TLS 1.0/1.1, privacy and security
 * concerns prevail, which is why we have switched off the use of this
 * service by default.
 *
 * To re-enable this service set
 *
 *     app.normandy.enabled=true
 *
 * in about:config.
 *
 * Since firefox-91.0 we no longer install multiple shortcuts for
 * each supported display protocol.  Instead we will only install
 * one generic Mozilla Firefox shortcut.
 * If you still want to be able to select between running Mozilla Firefox
 * on X11 or Wayland, you have to re-create these shortcuts on your own.
 * Optional programs for extra features:
 *   x11-libs/libnotify for desktop notifications
 *   gnome-base/gsettings-desktop-schemas for fallback mouse cursor theme e.g. on WMs

 * GNU info directory index is up-to-date.
