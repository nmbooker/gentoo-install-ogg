 * Messages for package app-editors/emacs-28.2-r6:

 * Your version of GTK+ will have problems with closing open
 * displays. This is no problem if you just use one display, but
 * if you use more than one and close one of them Emacs may crash.
 * See <https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/issues/221> and
 * <https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/issues/2315>.
 * If you intend to use more than one display, then it is strongly
 * recommended that you compile Emacs with the Athena/Lucid or the
 * Motif toolkit instead.
