# gentoo-install-ogg-bootstrap

Put these on an external disk to allow easy installation.

## bootstrap.sh

You can put this on an external or the target disk to run after first boot.
It will configure and install just enough to get the rest of the latest
version of gentoo-install-ogg into /home/nick

## gentoo-install.tar.gz

Extract this on a LiveDVD to prepare the disks and get gentoo installed enough
to boot.

The config is already set up for a basic unencrypted system.  This config isn't what
I will be using for real though.
